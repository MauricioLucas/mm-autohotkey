 * Public function starts with capitalized word. Private function starts with non-capitalized word. Function name must start the line. Order of the functions in the module is alphabetical.

 * Function arguments all start with capitalized word and are used as such in function body. Local arguments always start with small letter (the rest is hungarian style). 

 * Function comments are given in multiline comment style with the ending token having one space before it.

 * Subroutines local to the function have the same name as function (unless there are more then 1).

 * No single line comment in the function body starts the line.

 * Documentation is in Natural Doc format.
